# Snake Game Development Prompt Log

This file maintains a chronological log of the prompts and development steps in creating this Snake game.

## Initial Setup and Framework Selection

**Prompt:**
> Hi! Let's make a game! I want it to be a hybrid game. That I can build and distribute to android, ios and HTML. In the first step I want to for HTML only but keep in mind that later I should be able to port it to ios & android. What is the best framework or tool to build this game?

**Response Summary:**
- Recommended Phaser.js with Capacitor
- Phaser.js for game development
- Capacitor for future mobile deployment
- Explained benefits of this combination

## Development Environment Setup

**Response Summary:**
- Added Vite for:
  - Fast development server
  - Hot Module Replacement
  - TypeScript support
  - Modern development experience

## Project Structure Setup

**Prompt:**
> Yes, lets start by setting that up. This directory is a git repository so we can just set it up in the current directory

**Response Summary:**
Created basic project structure with:
- Vite configuration
- TypeScript setup
- Basic game scene
- Project dependencies

## Repository Setup

**Prompt:**
> Ok, can we rename the game from "Snake Game" to just "Snake"

**Response Summary:**
Updated all references from "Snake Game" to "Snake" in:
- README.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md

## Game Implementation

**Prompt:**
> Ok, lets build the game itself. The game is a Nokia classic game. You could play it on the Nokia 5110. The game is simple. You have a reqtangle field, there is a snake (simple blocked line) that moves around with the arrow keys. The snake only goes up, down, left & right. The rest of its body follows the same path. There is a candy (simple block) somewhere on the field. If the snake goes over the candy, the lentgh of the snake is increased with one block (added to the back). The eaten candy disapears and a new one pops up somewhere random on the field.

**Response Summary:**
Implemented classic Snake game with:
- Grid-based movement system
- Snake class for managing snake behavior
- Candy spawning system
- Collision detection
- Score tracking
- Game over handling
- Arrow key controls

## Adding AI Guidelines

**Prompt:**
> Don't forget to always update the prompt log. Is there a way to let you know that you always need to do this? Some document with a set of rules or something like that?

**Response Summary:**
- Created CONTRIBUTING_AI.md file with guidelines for AI assistants
- Established rules for maintaining PROMPT_LOG.md
- Added format templates for updates
- Created procedures for documentation updates
- Set commit message guidelines

## Game Restart Bug Fix

**Prompt:**
> Let's continue. There is a problem with the game. The first time I play it, it all works. When I return to the menu and press play for the second time, the game does not work. I do not see any errors. The snake and candy are not on the screen

**Response Summary:**
- Added proper scene cleanup and initialization
- Implemented `init()` method to reset game state
- Created `cleanupScene()` method to properly destroy graphics and remove event listeners
- Added `shutdown()` method for scene cleanup
- Separated control setup into its own method
- Fixed graphics context handling for proper scene restarts

## Mobile Controls Implementation

**Prompt:**
> Lets make it work on mobile, where we don't have a keyboard. So keep the keyboard controls but add swiping to turn the snake in the direction.

**Response Summary:**
- Added swipe controls while maintaining keyboard support
- Implemented swipe detection with configurable parameters:
  - Minimum swipe distance (30 pixels)
  - Maximum swipe time (1000ms)
- Added swipe state management
- Implemented directional swipe logic:
  - Horizontal swipes for left/right
  - Vertical swipes for up/down
- Added pointer event handlers for:
  - pointerdown (start of swipe)
  - pointerup (end of swipe)
  - pointerout (cancel swipe)

## Mobile Game Over Screen

**Prompt:**
> There is one problem. When the player dies, they need to press the ESC button but on mobile there is no keyboard. How would you fix that?

**Response Summary:**
- Added touchable "Return to Menu" button to game over screen

## Version Control Guidelines

**Prompt:**
> Ok, lets stop with committing after every change. Only commit when asked.

**Response Summary:**
- Changed version control approach:
  - Will only commit changes when explicitly requested

  - Keeping changes staged until commit is requested

## Retro Style Implementation

**Prompt:**
> Ok, I like the gameplays as is, lets keep that. But I want to make it a more retro game. Do you know what the design style is of the Nokia 5110 screen?
